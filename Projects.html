        <b>Project Introduction</b> - Group Project
        <br>Last year(2023), Spotify chose to highlight the top streamed songs from different parts of the world via Wrap
        Mapped. While the web page serves as a quick visual summary of these statistics, one can’t help but ask:
        Are there any connections to be made between geographical regions and music preference?
        If so, what can we do with these connections? What insights can we extract from this?
        This is ultimately the goal of our project where we aim to shed light on the music preference and patterns
        of various regions/countries and how cultural globalisation has impacted the music industry.
        This program includes but not limited to, a predictive algorithm for song recommendations,
        a function that returns the most common artist/song between two countries,
        and a function which returns the country that has the most commonly occurring artist/song with a chosen country.
        In terms of visual output, we created interactive world maps depicting the top songs by continent,
        country, city and similarity scores between regions respectively,
        along with an interactive console which the user can utilise to draw further insights.

        <b>Project Introduction</b> - Group Project
        <br>This project utilizes an interactive console to play a text adventure game. Our game is designed
        to be similar to an escape room where the player has to find specific items, type in specific action/word,
        and/or overcome obstacles to unlock and go into the next room. There is also an inventory where user's can check
        their current progress. The user wins if they complete the escape room in a limited amount of steps. (The Github
        for this project is currently set as private due to the university's restriction, contact me for more information)

        <b>Project Introduction</b> - Learning Project
        <br>I learned from an engineer(丁文謙) to create this project. It is a program that takes in at most 17 characters
        in the console and generates a QR code based on the user's input.

        <b>Project Introduction</b> - Individual Project
        <br>This project was inspired by my experience working as a pizza and bread clerk at Fortinos to
        increase the operational efficiency of the ordering system by replacing the pen-and-paper system.
        This program includes a GUI that takes orders, sorts them, and simultaneously records relevant statistics to
        inform decision-making about processes like inventorying. However, this program has not been fully completed.
